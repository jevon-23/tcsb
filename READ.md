# tcsb Starter code
Starter code that has been written for my job as a coach for The Coder School

# Usage 
Whenever I write starter code, transferring it over to the student through zoom can usually be a hastle.
To avoid any messaging system, code that is pretty big can be recovered from here through either copy and paste or by fetching the repo.
